Workflow:
Run Macro -- 3D Visualizer.
Create Macro -- Give paths to first three files -- show layout -- ask for option -- ask for electrical/thermal options based on option
             -- ask for trace_ori/parasitic if electrical is chosen -- edit constraints? -- done.

Technology elements --> Adjust Layout --> Optimization Steps
Instead of all on one window, make it multiple windows (back, next)



TODO:
Make your UI look more like the MDK Editor.
Integrate the Technology Elements step with the MDK Editor (shouldn't be hard)
3D Visualizer!
