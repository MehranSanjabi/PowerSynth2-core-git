PowerSynth Core: This is the PowerSynth backend with the command line interface (CLI)

Naming scheme:
Generally, if it is a single short (<10 character) word, use all lower case, like ‘core’ ‘engine’. Use abbreviations if needed, like ‘opt’ (optimization). 
If it is a long multi-word phase, but it has a common abbreviation, use all caps, like ‘MDK’, ‘NSGAII’. Otherwise, use upper camel case with necessary abbreviations, like ‘ConstrGraph’, ‘AppNote’ (application note, such as Tristan’s API note to ARL). 
Do not use space and underlines at all times. Do not start a name with a digit (like ‘3DEngine’, make it ‘Engine3D’). Try to limit your file/folder name within 16 characters.
